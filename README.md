BitTweet-iOS-Tracker
====================

Issue tracker for BitTweet for iOS.

It is what it is! That's all. We'll be monitoring issues (which you can access to the right) based on bugs you experience, or other functionality you'd like to see!

If you experienced a crash, or some other unexpected behavior, please take a screenshot if possible, and include it in the issue. Thank you!!

Steps for reporting a bug:

1) The account name that you were on (e.g. @thepianistalex)

2) Steps to reproduce (e.g. I tapped on a user's icon in their personal timeline, and this caused a crash.)

3) If you do the same thing, does it happen again?

4) Phone information (e.g. iPhone 5 on 7.1.2)

5) Screenshot if applicable.


The more details, the better! This really helps us narrow down what's happening.

You can also request features. We will put them on our roadmap if applicable, and will try to get to them in a timely manner.

What not to do

1) Report that "I pressed the crash button and it crashed."

2) Report only "It crashed". Generally try to give more of a description (e.g. it crashed when I try to start the app)

3) Report non-issues (e.g. "BitTweet did not toast my bread. Make it toast my bread.")

4) Report only "This sucks". Why does it suck (e.g. The text is too small to tap, the timeline lags when I scroll.)
